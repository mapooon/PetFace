The official PyTorch implementation for the following paper:
> [**PetFace: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Animal Identification**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13555),  
> [Risa Shionoda](https://sites.google.com/view/risashinoda/home)* and [Kaede Shiohara](https://mapooon.github.io/)* (*Equal contribution),   
> *ECCV 2024*

## TL;DR: We established a large-scale animal identification dataset with more than 250k IDs across 13 families

## Dataset directory
Place the dataset as follows:
```
. (Root of this repository)
â””â”€â”€ data
    â””â”€â”€ PetFace
        â”œâ”€â”€ images
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cat
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 000000
        â”‚           â””â”€â”€ 00.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ split
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cat
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ train.csv
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ val.txt
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ test.txt
        â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ reidentification.csv 
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ verification.csv
        â””â”€â”€ annotations
            â””â”€â”€ cat.csv
         
```
train.csv: file names and id labels for training  
val.txt: file names for validation (not used in this codebase)  
test.txt: file names for verification (not used in this codebase)  
verification.csv: pairs of file names to verify and labels indicating whether the pairs have the same ID  
reidentification.csv: file names and id labels for re-identification  

# Setup
## pip (Unrecomemnded)
Install packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Docker (Recomemnded)
1) Pull a docker image:
```
docker pull pytorch/pytorch:1.12.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime
```
2) Replace the path in `exec.sh`.  
3) Execute the dokcer image:
```
bash exec.sh
```
4) Install packages:
```
bash install.sh
```

# Testing
Pretrained weights are provided on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZHxlvRUZSQeFrztz0GaKgyVUSCh1lT6?usp=sharing). 

## Re-identification
For example, you can run the evaluation of re-identification for cat as follows:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 src/reidentification.py -m arcface -w pretrained/arcface/cat.pt -i data/PetFace/split/cat/reidentification.csv -o results/reidentification/arcface/cat.csv
```
Then, you can compute the top-k (k={1,2,3,4,5}) accuracy:
```
python3 src/compute_topk_acc.py --topk 5 -i results/reidentification/arcface/cat.csv
```

## Verification
For example, you can run the evaluation of re-identification for cat as follows:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 src/verification.py -w pretrained/arcface/cat.pt -i data/PetFace/split/cat/verification.csv -o results/verification/arcface/cat.csv
```
Then, you can compute AUC:
```
python3 src/compute_auc.py -i results/verification/arcface/cat.csv
```



# Training
For example, you can run the training for cat as follows:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 src/train_arcface.py src/configs/cat.py  --output outputs/cat/arcface
```

Also, you can train an arcface model on all the species (families):
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 src/train_unified.py src/configs/unified.py  --output outputs/unified
```
